python 3.11 script that recreates figures from a senescence evolution manuscript. 
to fit a Gompertz - Makeham mortliaty curve and calculate a reproduction rate (that exclude offspring not reaching adulthood) for all species, run all parts of the lifedata_150725.py code.
the lifedata_150725.py script uses data from: Jones, O. R. et al. Diversity of ageing across the tree of life. Nature 505, 169â€“173 (2014).
to generate the manuscript figures, run all parts of the senescence_evolution_150725.py script.
the end of the code contains calls for funcctions that recreate the figures after running the imports, functions, and styles sections.
figures 3 and 4 are a composite of 12 figures produced by 4 runs of the respective function with each presented species as its parameter.
